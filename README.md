# Recognising Known Configurations of Garments For Dual-Arm Robotic Flattening
## Abstract
Robotic deformable-object manipulation is a challenge in the robotic industry because deformable objects have complicated and various object states. Predicting those object states and updating manipulation planning are time-consuming and computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose an effective robotic manipulation approach for recognising ‘known configurations’ of garments with a 'Known Configuration neural Network' (KCNet) and choosing pre-designed manipulation plans based on the recognised known configurations. Our robotic manipulation plan features a four-action strategy: finding two critical grasping points, stretching the garments, and lifting down the garments. We demonstrate that our approach only needs 98 seconds on average to flatten garments of five categories.

My name is Li Duan (Ken), and I am a final year PhD student at the University of Glasgow, Scotland. My interests include robot continuous perception and deformable object manipulation. Recently, I have been working on investigating geometric and physical properties of fabrics and garments, through which I am engineering methods to improve robot deformable object manipulations.\
