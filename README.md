# Recognising Known Configurations of Garments For Dual-Arm Robotic Flattening
## Abstract
Robotic deformable-object manipulation is a challenge in the robotic industry because deformable objects have complicated and various object states. Predicting those object states and updating manipulation planning is time-consuming and computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose learning known configurations of garments with a 'Known Configuration neural Network' (KCNet), which fundamentals an effective robotic garment flattening paradigm where a robot chose a pre-designed manipulation plan based on the recognised known configuration.

My name is Li Duan (Ken), and I am a final year PhD student at the University of Glasgow, Scotland. My interests include robot continuous perception and deformable object manipulation. Recently, I have been working on investigating geometric and physical properties of fabrics and garments, through which I am engineering methods to improve robot deformable object manipulations.\
