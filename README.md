# Known Configurations: An Effective Data-Driven Four-Action-Strategy Robotic Manipulation Approach for Deformable Object Flattening
## Abstract
Robotic deformable-object manipulation is a challenge in the robotic industry because deformable objects have complicated and various object states. Predicting those object states and updating manipulation routes are time-consuming and computationally costly. In this paper, we propose an effective robotic deformable-object manipulation approach by recognising the ‘known configurations’ of the garments with a 'known configuration network' (KCNet) and choosing pre-designed manipulation routes based on the recognised ‘known configurations’. Our manipulation routes feature a four-action strategy: finding two critical grasping points, stretching the garments, and lifting down the garments. We demonstrate that our approach is 65% faster than state-of-art(SOA) and enables manipulating garments with various shapes.

My name is Li Duan (Ken), and I am a final year PhD student at the University of Glasgow, Scotland. My interests include robot continuous perception and deformable object manipulation. Recently, I have been working on investigating geometric and physical properties of fabrics and garments, through which I am engineering methods to improve robot deformable object manipulations.\
